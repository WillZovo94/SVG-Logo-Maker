## Description
- This project includes a backend JavaScript SVG logo generator! Using inquirer, we have access to a style of questions which is used to create your very own SVG logo. You're given customizationo from the text, colors, and shape styling.
- My motivation for working and creating this project was to further understand inquirer, create tests using jest, understanding SVG creation more, and object-oriented programming.

## Usage 
- You're given access to a command prompt once you run (node index)
- Once you type in that input, the program runs... In which you're given access to various questions regarding the information required for your SVG image to be generated.
- Once that's done, you're given an .svg file with your design. There's a demostrated design already visible.
## Features 
- Access to a command prompt program that gathers your answers to various requests for an SVG image.
- Jtest test to see that the program is functional and working.
- Once completed you're given a new SVG file that is added to the examples folder.
